Generates stratified random samples from a land cover map resulting in a vector of random points and a csv with surface values ​​and an optimal number of samples for each type of vegetation. Also from a vector file of format points and land cover map in raster or vector, it offers the following results: 1.- Confusion matrix, 2.- Precision table (from the producer, user precision, global precision).
